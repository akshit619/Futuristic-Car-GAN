Used StudioGAN 0.2.0 release to train the SNGAN model.  
StudioGAN Repo: https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/PyTorch-StudioGAN   
This repo contains:  
1. the config file that we used in the json format.  
2. A log file which has all th hyperparameters and model architecture.  
3. The code which was used to train ResNet to predict latent codes (described briefly in abstract).  
4. The code for Car segmentation masking.
5. The results of our model during various training stages in form of image grid.
