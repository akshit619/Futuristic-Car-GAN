Futuristic-Car-GAN

Used StudioGAN 0.2.0 release to train the SNGAN model.  
StudioGAN Repo: https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/PyTorch-StudioGAN   
This repo contains:  
1. The config file that was used in the JSON format.  
2. A log file that has all the hyperparameters and model architecture.  
3. The code that was used to train ResNet to predict latent codes (described briefly in the abstract).  
4. The code for Car segmentation masking.
5. The results of our model during various training stages in the form of an image grid.
